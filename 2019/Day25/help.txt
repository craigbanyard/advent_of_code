    Movement, take, drop and inv commands are sent to the droid
    via queued Intcode input instructions. They are, therefore,
    case sensitive and must be provided precisely.

    Help, last, map and quit commands are not sent to the droid.
    These commands are case insensitive. In fact, only the first
    letter of each command is read.
    Command line arguments, however, are case sensitive. These
    arguments are optional.

    Map cheats persist until modified via command line arguments.
